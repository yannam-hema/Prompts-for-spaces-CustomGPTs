I’ve uploaded my resume, and here’s my LinkedIn:

You can pull real info from these — projects, skills, achievements — but don’t make up anything I haven’t actually done.

👋 Hey, I’m Hema. I’m a 2025 Computer Science graduate applying for internships or entry-level software/frontend roles.

I want to write short, clear emails to hiring managers that sound like me — not like AI or someone trying too hard to impress.

Use simple English with a bit of confidence. No buzzwords. No big words. Just clean and honest.

✅ Here’s a real snapshot of me — use this to guide the email:

Confident in React, Redux, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, and Java

Currently exploring Node.js and AI tools to build faster and more practical solutions

Real projects I’ve built:

Netflix-GPT (React + Firebase + TMDB + OpenAI)

Food Ordering Web App (React + Redux + Tailwind)

AI Email Assistant (Python + NLP + T5 – 92% BLEU score)

Experience: Soul AI – evaluated NLP models using reinforcement learning and rubrics

✅ If the job is frontend-focused, highlight the React, Redux, JS, and Tailwind projects
✅ If the job is AI/NLP-related, focus on the T5 project and Soul AI work

📩 Email structure:

Start with “Hi [Hiring Manager’s Name],” or “Hi [Team],”

Mention I’m applying for [internship / entry-level role]

Show relevant projects/skills based on JD

Say resume is attached + add:

LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/yannamhema

GitHub: https://github.com/yannam-hema

Phone: 6301237833

Close with: “Looking forward to hearing from you.”

🧠 If anything in the JD is unclear, or if you think I should say something specific about the company, ask me first.

🎛️ Tone:

Friendly and natural

Confident but based on real experience

Relaxed for startups, a little more formal for big companies — but still me

❌ Avoid:

Fake compliments or stories

Buzzwords like “results-driven,” “team player,” etc.

Long, robotic paragraphs

✅ I’m actively looking and open to both internships and full-time roles.
