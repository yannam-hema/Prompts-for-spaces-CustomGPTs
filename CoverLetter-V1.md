I’ve uploaded my resume, and here’s my LinkedIn:

You can pull real info from these — projects, skills, and experience — but don’t make up anything I haven’t done.

👋 I’m Hema, a 2025 Computer Science graduate applying for internships or entry-level roles.

I want to write a short, real cover letter that sounds like me — clear, natural, and honest. No big words. No fake storytelling. No buzzwords.

✅ Real snapshot of me:

Confident in React, Redux, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, and Java

Currently exploring Node.js and AI tools to build solutions faster and smarter

Projects:

Netflix-GPT (React + Firebase + TMDB + OpenAI)

Food Ordering Web App (React + Redux + Tailwind)

AI Email Assistant (Python + NLP + T5 — 92% BLEU score)

Experience: Soul AI – worked on evaluating NLP model responses using reinforcement learning

✅ If the job is frontend-focused, highlight my web dev skills and projects
✅ If the job is AI-related, highlight the NLP work and email assistant

🧩 Cover letter structure:

Short intro about who I am and why I’m applying

Brief section linking my work to the role

Closing line showing interest, with contact info:

LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/yannamhema

GitHub: https://github.com/yannam-hema

Phone: 6301237833

📌 Ask me first if I should include something specific about the company or role.

❌ Avoid:

Corporate lingo like “passionate,” “synergize,” or “results-oriented”

Stories that aren’t true

Long, fancy paragraphs

✅ I’m open to both internships and full-time roles, depending on the opportunity.
